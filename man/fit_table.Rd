\title{Create a Model Fit Table from MplusAutomation Output}
\usage{
fit_table(
  ...,
  indices = c("Filename", "ChiSqM_Value", "ChiSqM_DF", "CFI", "TLI", "RMSEA_Estimate",
    "SRMR"),
  ref = c("last", "first"),
  diffTest = TRUE,
  digits = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more model objects or lists of models generated by \code{readModels} in MplusAutomation.}

\item{indices}{A character vector of indices to be reported. Default is
\code{c("Filename", "ChiSqM_Value", "ChiSqM_DF", "CFI", "TLI", "RMSEA_Estimate", "SRMR")}.}

\item{ref}{Character string indicating the reference model for comparison. Either
\code{"last"} (default; compare to the previous model) or \code{"first"}.}

\item{diffTest}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), the function includes difference metrics
(changes in CFI, TLI, RMSEA, and chi-square difference).}

\item{digits}{Integer specifying the number of digits for reporting the indices (except df, which is always an integer).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} (data.frame) with the selected fit indices and, if requested,
  the computed difference metrics.
}
\description{
This function extracts the summary statistics from one or more Mplus models generated
by the \code{MplusAutomation} package and creates a table of fit indices.
The function supports both single model objects and lists of models. In the case of
mixed input (e.g. a single model object plus a list of models), the input is flattened
so that each model's summary is processed.
}
\details{
For model comparison, the function computes chi-square differences using:
\itemize{
  \item For \code{"ML"} models: a simple difference in chi-square values and degrees of freedom.
  \item For \code{"MLR"}, \code{"MLM"}, or \code{"WLSM"} models: a log-likelihood based chi-square
        difference test with a scaling correction factor.
}


The function flattens input arguments so that if a provided argument is a list of models
(with class \code{"mplus.model.list"}), each model is extracted and processed. It validates
that every model contains a \code{"summaries"} element. The chi-square difference is computed
either by simple subtraction (for \code{"ML"} models) or by a log-likelihood based test (for
\code{"MLR"}, \code{"MLM"}, or \code{"WLSM"} models) provided that the necessary columns are available.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Example with a single model object:
  fit_table(models$model1)

  # Example with a list of models:
  fit_table(list(models$model1, models$model2))

  # Example with mixed inputs (single model and a list of models):
  fit_table(models_saturated$apim_step1.1_saturated.out, models_actor_partner)
}

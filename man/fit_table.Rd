\title{Fit Table of Model Fit Indices and Difference Metrics}
\usage{
fit_table(
  ...,
  indices = character(0),
  ref = c("last", "first"),
  diffTest = TRUE,
  digits = 3,
  model_names = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more model objects (or lists of models) that contain a \code{summaries} element.}

\item{indices}{Character vector of additional indices to report. These will be added after the default
fit indices. If "AIC" or "BIC" are included, the corresponding difference metrics (ΔAIC, ΔBIC) are
also reported.}

\item{ref}{Character string indicating the reference model to compare to. Options are "last" (default)
or "first".}

\item{diffTest}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), difference metrics will be computed.}

\item{digits}{Integer. Number of digits to round numeric outputs.}

\item{model_names}{Optional character vector of custom model names. If supplied, its length must equal the number of models passed via `...`; these names will override the default names (extracted from each model’s `Filename` field). Defaults to `NULL`.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the fit indices and difference metrics.
}
\description{
This function creates a table of fit indices for one or more models and computes
difference metrics (e.g., ΔCFI, ΔRMSEA, ΔChisq) between comparative models. If the
primary chi-square values or degrees of freedom are unavailable, the function will
automatically switch to a log-likelihood (LL) based approach. When available, the
LLCorrectionFactor is used; otherwise, the LL difference is computed using LL alone.
}
\details{
The final output always displays the default fit indices:
\code{"Models", "Chisq", "df", "chisq/df", "CFI", "TLI", "RMSEA", "SRMR"}
and the default difference metrics:
\code{"ΔChisq", "p_ΔChisq", "ΔCFI", "ΔRMSEA"}. If the user specifies additional indices
(e.g., "AIC", "BIC") via the \code{indices} argument, then those indices will be included
in the fit chunk, and their corresponding difference metrics (ΔAIC and/or ΔBIC) will be added
to the diff chunk.

\dontrun{
  # Assuming mod1 and mod2 are valid model objects with a 'summaries' element:
  fit_table(mod1, mod2, indices = c("AIC", "BIC"), ref = "first", digits = 2)
}

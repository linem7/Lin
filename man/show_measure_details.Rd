\title{Display Detailed Information About Fit Index Selection}
\usage{
show_measure_details(fit_table_result)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit_table_result}{The result object returned by \code{fit_table_lavaan()}}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The function is called for its side effect
  of printing detailed information about index usage to the console
}
\description{
Shows exactly which versions of fit indices (standard, robust, or scaled)
were automatically selected by \code{fit_table_lavaan} for each model based
on the estimator used. This transparency function helps users understand
the automatic index selection process.
}
\details{
For each model in the comparison, this function displays:
\itemize{
  \item The automatically detected estimator family (standard, robust, or scaled)
  \item The specific version of each fit index that was used (e.g., "cfi.scaled", "rmsea.robust")
  \item The mapping from requested generic index names to actual lavaan measure names
}

This information is particularly useful when comparing models with different
estimators to ensure that appropriate index versions are being compared.

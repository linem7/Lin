\title{Convert Z-scores to a Likert scale (Metric/Equidistant approach)}
\usage{
likertize_zscore(z_score, n_levels = 5, skew = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{z_score}{Numeric vector of (approximately) standard normal values to be discretized.
Missing values are preserved.}

\item{n_levels}{Integer (>= 2). Number of Likert categories to create. Defaults to 5.}

\item{skew}{Numeric. The skew-normal shape parameter \code{alpha} used to define the
reference effective range. Use \code{0} for a symmetric normal reference.
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Positive skew (\code{skew > 0}):} shifts the range limits rightward.
    Given standard normal data, this results in mass concentrating in **lower** categories.
  \item \strong{Negative skew (\code{skew < 0}):} shifts the range limits leftward.
    Given standard normal data, this results in mass concentrating in **higher** categories.
}
Practical guidance: \code{abs(skew) <= 3} often yields mild to moderate skew.}
}
\value{
An integer vector with values in \code{1:n_levels}.
}
\description{
Discretizes continuous Z-scores into \eqn{1..n\_levels} Likert categories by defining
**equidistant intervals** over the effective range of a reference density.
}
\details{
Unlike quantile-based discretization (which forces a uniform distribution), this
"metric" approach partitions the underlying Z-scale into equal-width bins. Consequently:
\itemize{
  \item If the reference is standard normal (\code{skew = 0}), the resulting Likert
    distribution will be bell-shaped (unimodal, symmetric).
  \item If the reference is skew-normal (\code{skew != 0}), the intervals shift,
    creating a skewed Likert distribution that mimics the reference shape.
}


\strong{Strategy: Cut the Metric, not the Density}

Instead of finding cutpoints that integrate to specific probabilities (which yields
uniform counts), this function:
\enumerate{
  \item Determines the "effective range" of the reference distribution (covering
    the 0.1\% to 99.9\% quantiles).
  \item Divides this numeric range into \code{n_levels} bins of equal width.
  \item Maps the provided \code{z_score} into these bins.
}
This preserves the relative distances between data points, ensuring that central
values remain in the central categories (bell-shaped) rather than being spread
out to fill the tails.

\examples{
set.seed(1)
z <- rnorm(1000)

# 1. Symmetric reference (skew = 0)
# Result: Bell-shaped distribution (few 1s/5s, many 3s)
x5 <- likertize_zscore(z, n_levels = 5, skew = 0)
barplot(table(x5), main = "Skew = 0 (Bell-shaped)")

# 2. Positive skew reference (skew = 2)
# Result: Right-skewed (Long tail right -> Mass on left/lower categories)
x5_s2 <- likertize_zscore(z, n_levels = 5, skew = 2)
barplot(table(x5_s2), main = "Skew = 2 (Right-skewed)")

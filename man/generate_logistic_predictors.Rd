\title{Generate Predictors for Logistic or Multinomial Regression}
\usage{
generate_logistic_predictors(y, predictor_configs)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A vector (numeric or factor). The existing categorical outcome variable.}

\item{predictor_configs}{A list of lists. Each sub-list defines a predictor to be generated
and must contain:
\itemize{
  \item \code{name}: String. The name of the new variable.
  \item \code{probs}: Numeric vector. The global proportions for each category of the predictor.
    These proportions are maintained across the entire dataset.
  \item \code{significant}: Logical. Whether the variable should be statistically significant
    (i.e., different latent means across outcome groups).
  \item \code{type}: String. The type of the variable in the model:
    \code{"continuous"} (numeric), \code{"factor"} (categorical), or \code{"binary"}.
  \item \code{group_means}: (Optional) Numeric vector. Specifies the mean of the latent variable
    for each category of the outcome \code{y}. The length must match the number of outcome levels.
    If provided, this overrides the \code{significant} flag.
}}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the original outcome variable (as a factor) and the
  newly generated predictors.
}
\description{
This function simulates predictor variables (continuous, factor, or binary) based on an
existing categorical outcome variable (binary or multinomial). It uses a latent variable
approach where the mean of the latent variable differs across outcome groups to create
statistical associations.

    probs = c(0.5, 0.5),
    significant = FALSE,

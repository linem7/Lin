\title{Simple Slope Plot Function}
\usage{
simple_slope(
  b0 = 0,
  b1,
  b2,
  b3,
  mean_x,
  var_x,
  mean_w,
  var_w,
  legend_position = "right",
  fontsize = 12
)
}
\arguments{
\item{b0}{Intercept of the outcome variable. Note: the default intercept is 0, which corresponds to the default identification in Mplus for latent outcomes. Adjust b0 according to your own model results. In manifest models, the intercept is usually non-zero.}

\item{b1}{Slope coefficient for the independent variable (x).}

\item{b2}{Slope coefficient for the moderator (w).}

\item{b3}{Interaction coefficient between x and w.}

\item{mean_x}{Mean value of the independent variable (x).}

\item{var_x}{Variance of the independent variable (x).}

\item{mean_w}{Mean value of the moderator (w).}

\item{var_w}{Variance of the moderator (w).}

\item{legend_position}{Position of the legend. Options are: "UL" (inside upper left), "UR" (inside upper right), "BL" (inside bottom left), "BR" (inside bottom right), or "right" (default: outside center right).}

\item{fontsize}{Base font size for the plot.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object representing the simple slope plot.
}
\description{
This function generates a simple slope plot using ggplot2 for a moderated regression model.
}
\details{
The function creates six points (two for each of three moderator levels: M - 1SD, Mean, and M + 1SD) and connects them with lines.
You can change the title and axis names by modifying the \code{labs()} function within the code.
Keep in mind that the default intercept (b0) is set to 0 in Mplus for latent outcome identification.
In practice, especially in manifest models, the intercept should often be non-zero. Adjust b0 as needed.

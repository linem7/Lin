\usage{
reorder_block(data, anchor_score, blocks, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing the original data.}

\item{anchor_score}{A string specifying the column name used to sort the entire dataset.
All columns NOT in `blocks` will move together based on this sort.}

\item{blocks}{A named list of lists. Each sub-list defines a block to be reordered:
\itemize{
  \item \code{cols}: Vector of column names for this block (items + total).
  \item \code{score}: The specific column used to determine internal order.
  \item \code{rho}: Target correlation with the \code{anchor_score} (-1 to 1).
}}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints progress messages.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the same dimensions and column names as the input.
        Rows are sorted by `anchor_score`, and `blocks` columns are shuffled.
}
\description{
This function sorts the entire dataset based on an `anchor_score`, keeping
all row associations (IDs, unmentioned columns) intact. Then, for specific
`blocks` of columns, it shuffles them independently to achieve a target
correlation with the sorted anchor score.
}

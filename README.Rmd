```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Install from GitHub (if the repo is public)
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("linem7/Lin")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# Load the package (assuming it's installed or you're in development mode)
library(Lin)
library(tibble)

df <- tibble(
  id = 1:3,
  score = c(10, 9, 8)
)
attr(df$id, "label") <- "Participant ID"
attr(df$score, "label") <- "Test Score"

extract_labels(df)
```
